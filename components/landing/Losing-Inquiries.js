                        <p>Don’t have a safari website for their business</p>
                        <p>How much money your safari companies have already lost for not having a world-class safari website?? 
                            Is it 1000$, 2000$ or $10,000 every day? A recent survey found that 42% of small safari companies don’t
                             have a website for their business. Are not the figures really surprising? I meant when 3 billion of
                             your potential customers spend an average of 10 hours a day on the internet, Is it wise to not have 
                             an online presence??
                        </p>
                        <p>Most the safari operators sending lots of money on their SAFARI GUIDES, OUTDOOR EQUIPMENT, SAFARI FLEETS,
                             and INVEST in the INTERIOR DESIGN OF THEIR OFFICE. Because they don’t understand customers will not knock
                              on their doors.
                        </p>
                        <p>Even when a prospect visits your company/office to inquire or get more information your representative
                             briefs them or motivates them to understand and buy your services. But your website is your online 
                             shop that doesn’t need a salesperson to educate your customers. A well-presented and informative 
                             safari website can convert website users to paying customers in a fraction of the time. You just 
                             have to understand what your potential customers need and design a professional website according 
                             to that.
                        </p>
                        <p>Not having a solid marketing plan to achieve your goals</p>
                        <p>The competition in the Safari Business is sky high and to sustain the business one needs to behave a 
                            result-oriented 360 marketing plan. And that’s why those operators who have knowledge about the marketing
                             secrets are becoming more successful and those who don’t know are losing inquiries and letting their 
                             competitors stay ahead from them. Don’t you think that is how your business going on currently?
                        </p>
                        <p>Even some of the safari operators enter with no guaranteed marketing plan? They work with companies who 
                            don’t know about what is Serengeti, who are never being Tanzania to understand the whole eco-system 
                            of a customer, and who don’t know what is peak season and low season. Even they don’t
                             know what a USA & UK people search before they book an African Safari.
                             </p>
                        <p>Do you know there are almost more than 2 Million people searching safari-related keywords on Google??

                        <p>With the highly emerging challenges in the safari market, if you’re potential safari customers won’t find
                             you then how you will generate bookings for your safari Business???
                        </p>
                        <p>Not appearing in the top search results can be the difference between the success and failure of your safari Business.</p>
                        <p>You are sharing your Profits to Your Agents</p>
                        <p>Is not it painful to benefit a third-party business by throwing a huge share of your Profits? Most safari 
                            companies share a strong opinion that Safari Agents are the game changer for their safari business. 
                            But Do they really? Have you ever analyzed how much money you are throwing away by completely depending 
                            on Agents? 
                        </p>
                        <p>When as a safari company you make all the efforts and hard work to make your safari customers' trip a 
                            memorable one, why you are providing your hard-earned money to a third-party agent who does not 
                            even make 0.01% effort? Of course, they provide a lot of customers to you, but have you ever 
                            analyzed how much $ you are losing by that process?
                        </p>
                        <p>As a safari owner if you want to get all the profits for your safari company then you need to 
                            reach your customers directly through online marketing but if you will rely on Agents then 
                            you are going to benefit their business more compared to your safari business.
                        </p>
