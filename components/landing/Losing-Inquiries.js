                        <p className="text-lg pb-4">How much money your safari companies have already lost for not having a world-class safari website?? 
                            Is it 1000$, 2000$ or $10,000 every day? A recent survey found that 42% of small safari companies don’t
                             have a website for their business. Are not the figures really surprising?<span className="font-bold text-md"> I meant when 3 billion of
                             your potential customers spend an average of 10 hours a day on the internet</span>, Is it wise to not have 
                             an online presence??
                        </p>
                        <p className="text-lg pb-4">Most the safari operators sending lots of money on their SAFARI GUIDES, OUTDOOR EQUIPMENT, 
                            <span className="font-bold text-md">SAFARI FLEETS,
                             and INVEST in the INTERIOR DESIGN OF THEIR OFFICE. Because they don’t understand customers will not knock
                              on their doors.</span>
                        </p>
                        <p className="text-lg pb-4">Even when a prospect visits your company/office to inquire or get more information your representative
                             briefs them or motivates them to understand and buy your services.<span className="font-bold text-md"> But your website is your online 
                             shop that doesn’t need a salesperson to educate your customers.</span> A well-presented and informative 
                             safari website can convert website users to paying customers in a fraction of the time. You just 
                             have to understand what your potential customers need and design a professional website according 
                             to that.

                        <p className="lext-lg pb-4">The competition in the Safari Business is sky high and to sustain the business one needs to behave a 
                            result-oriented 360 marketing plan. And that’s why those operators <span className="font-bold text-md "> who have knowledge about the marketing
                             secrets are becoming more successful and those who don’t know are losing inquiries and letting their 
                             competitors stay ahead from them.</span> Don’t you think that is how your business going on currently?

                        <p className="text-lg pb-4">Even some of the safari operators enter with no guaranteed marketing plan? They work with companies <span className="font-bold text-md"> who 
                            don’t know about what is Serengeti, who are never being Tanzania to understand the whole eco-system 
                            of a customer, and who don’t know what is peak season and low season. Even they don’t
                             know what a USA & UK people search before they book an African Safari.</span>

                        </p>
                        <p className="text-lg pb-4">When as a safari company you make all the efforts and hard work to make your safari customers' trip a 
                            memorable one, why you are providing your hard-earned money to a third-party agent who does not 
                            even make 0.01% effort? <span className="text-xl font-bold"> Of course, they provide a lot of customers to you, but have you ever 
                            analyzed how much $ you are losing by that process?</span>
                        </p>
                        <p  className="text-lg pb-4">As a safari owner if <span className="text-xl font-bold">you want to get all the profits for your safari company then you need to 
                            reach your customers directly through online marketing but if you will rely on Agents</span> then 
                            you are going to benefit their business more compared to your safari business.
