          <p className="font700 text-[20px] text-[#4679c5]">Many individuals wondered why we wanted to work with Tour Operators in Africa! But, this decision wasn’t taken on impulse, we had a specific reason!</p>

It would’ve been easy to go where the demand was.</p>
            <p className="font-montserrat font-normal text-[18px] text-left text-[#787878] leading-[1.5] m-0 py-[15px] pt-0 pb-[17px]">But, when we started our company our board of directors had a concrete goal in mind. We wanted to change the whole world for individuals who knew nothing about digital marketing. This was not a popular decision, to say the least. We had a lot of fallout and many people made mocking remarks. Because according to them – how were we going to manage a business in a country that didn’t even have basic facilities like food?</p>
            <p className="font-montserrat font-normal text-[18px] text-left text-[#787878] leading-[1.5] m-0 py-[15px] pt-0 pb-[17px]">A big question arose – How will Safari Marketing Pro survive? But as our founder had a goal, he stuck to it and didn’t let outside factors affect his ultimate goal. He has a saying – <span className='font700 text-[#787878]'>“Risk is not where the risk exists, Risk is somewhere where work exists. And, that’s why we love to take risks.”</span></p>

And, when we reached Africa we straightaway had a realization that they knew next to nothing about Digital Marketing</p>

And these agents were just sitting comfortably in an air-conditioned room and conducting a sub-par job of digital marketing. They used the tour operators as ground handlers. All of these tour operators didn’t even realize that they were missing out on huge opportunities.</p>

No one understood our vision and even when we tried to sell them websites free of cost they didn’t accept. They had a mindset that we were based in India so how could we understand the ecosystem of Africa?</p>
            <p className="font-montserrat font-normal text-[18px] text-left text-[#787878] leading-[1.5] m-0 py-[15px] pt-0 pb-[17px]">We understood why this obstacle happened. So, we decided to get ahead of the problem and visited each corner of Africa. We sat down with safari operators and saw their struggles and challenges working with B2B agents. After this fascinating journey, we had an overall understanding of the tour and safari business. We learned 3 important things:</p>
